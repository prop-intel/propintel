# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Traditional web analytics tools (Google Analytics, Plausible) focus on *human* visitors. However, the rise of Answer Engines (SearchGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) has created a new SEO paradigm: **AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)**. Webmasters don't just need to know *if* bots are visiting; they need to know *if* they are being cited as the answer.

## Solution
PropIntel is an **AEO Intelligence Platform**. It doesn't just track passive bot traffic; it **actively simulates** AI searches to see how your content performs.
1.  **Simulates**: Runs real queries on Tavily, Perplexity, and Google to see who ranks.
2.  **Analyzes**: Compares your content against the "winning" competitors.
3.  **Optimizes**: Generates specific recommendations and **Cursor Prompts** to rewrite your content for maximum AI visibility.

## User Experience Goals
-   **Action-Oriented**: Moving beyond passive charts to active "Fix this" prompts.
-   **Developer-First**: The "Cursor Prompt" feature is a key workflow integrator.
-   **Transparency**: Demystifying why one site is cited over another.

## Target Audience
-   Technical SEOs & AEO Specialists
-   Content Engineers
-   Developers building for the AI web
