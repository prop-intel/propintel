# BRAND SITE

## A Pitch Presentation

---

FADE IN:

### INT. REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY

*A small conference room with a projection screen. Three FOUNDERS prepare for their pitch presentation. FRANCISCO, late 20s, confident demeanor, stands at the front. ERIC, technical co-founder, reviews notes nearby. NATALIE adjusts the laptop connected to the projector. A COACH sits in the back, observing.*

**COACH**
Go ahead.

*Francisco takes position. A beat.*

**FRANCISCO**
(uncertain)
Like that?

*The Coach nods. Francisco centers himself, then begins.*

---

### TAKE ONE

**FRANCISCO**
(building momentum)
Hi, I'm Francisco. And for the last twenty years, it's all been about search, search, search. Google. Bing. Yahoo. If you weren't at the top of those searches, you weren't being clicked on. And you weren't getting any business.

*He pauses for effect.*

**FRANCISCO (CONT'D)**
Now the landscape has changed.

*Francisco steps forward, engaging the imaginary audience.*

**FRANCISCO (CONT'D)**
Now it's about answers. It's about having conversations with AI. If you weren't part of the conversation, you're not getting any business.

(confident)
So what we present to you is Brand Site. Brand Site allows us to give you a path to know where you are, where to go, and where to be -- so that your business is a part of that conversation.

*He gestures to his partners.*

**FRANCISCO (CONT'D)**
And to dive deeper, I have my two partners here -- Eric and Natalie.

(to Eric)
Eric?

---

*Eric steps forward, slightly nervous but knowledgeable.*

**ERIC**
SEO still matters, but it's not enough. Before we talk about recommendations, let's talk about foundations.

*He clicks to the next slide.*

**ERIC (CONT'D)**
Every major AI system already crawls the web. OpenAI. Anthropic. Perplexity. Google. Brand Site helps track when they visit, what pages they visit, and if they're being blocked.

(pointing to screen)
Getting started is as easy as copying the script and pasting it into your site.

*He clicks again.*

**ERIC (CONT'D)**
But tracking isn't enough. We need to also know what the AI can see -- what they're allowed to see -- through the robots.txt and llms.txt files. We help you with recommendations on how to improve both.

---

*Natalie takes over, turning toward the screen rather than the audience.*

**NATALIE**
(quietly, to the screen)
So now you're visible. You're being crawled. But that's not enough. Here's the shift -- being crawled doesn't mean you're being recommended. And that's where traditional SEO tools stop, and where Brand Site goes deeper.

*She clicks through slides, still facing away.*

**NATALIE (CONT'D)**
This simulates real user queries. We analyze how your company is doing compared to competitors. We identify gaps in your content that might be hurting your brand visibility.

(barely audible)
But our true differentiator is the recommendations.

---

*Francisco jumps back in for the close.*

**FRANCISCO**
And why does this matter? By 2026, traditional search activity is going to go down by twenty-five percent, replaced by AI conversations. By 2028, one hundred fifty billion dollars in buying decisions will be flowing through AI.

*He looks directly at the audience.*

**FRANCISCO (CONT'D)**
We want to bring your business into that conversation. I invite you to go to our site, start your journey, and let us take you to where you need to be.

(beat)
Thank you for your time.

### THE FEEDBACK

*Silence. The Coach checks their watch.*

**COACH**
Four minutes.

*The founders exchange glances.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
(matter-of-fact)
Macro level? Pretty good start. Bad middle. Second middle, OK, better. Pretty good ending.

*Francisco nods, taking notes mentally.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
The story you're telling is really powerful -- the world is shifting from this to this, and now you want to succeed in this new world, you have to keep up. That story makes sense. The intro largely made sense.

*He leans forward.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
But you got lost in the granular features. What's going on behind the scenes. You didn't tell me enough of the preview. The preview for the movie, so to speak.

*He turns to Natalie.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
Natalie, you looked at the screen while you were talking. You didn't talk to the audience at all. You seemed to have this phobia of speaking on stage.

**NATALIE**
(defensive)
I know--

**COACH**
(interrupting, sincere)
It's real, I get it. But you are a good speaker. You are good. You've been talking for eight weeks, articulating difficult concepts in English. You can do this.

*He stands.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
Let's run it from the top. Eric -- we're getting lost in the details. We're not keeping it fun, digestible, and informative. And Natalie? Talk loud. Project your voice. Use hand motions.

(pause)
Get over the phobia of speaking on stage. You're a wonderful speaker.

### TAKE TWO

*The founders reset. Francisco finds his mark.*

**FRANCISCO**
(stronger)
Hi, I'm Francisco. For the last twenty years, everything has been about search, search, search. And if you weren't at the top of the search, you weren't getting clicks, and your business wasn't going well.

*He hits his stride.*

**FRANCISCO (CONT'D)**
Now the landscape is changing. Now it's about AI conversations. Now you need another way to navigate these new waters.

(with conviction)
I bring to you Brand Site. This is an application that we made to allow you to find out where you are, where you need to be, and a complete plan to get you there.

*He gestures smoothly to Eric.*

**FRANCISCO (CONT'D)**
Now, to dive deeper, I have my partners here -- Eric and Natalie. Eric?

---

*Eric steps up, more composed.*

**ERIC**
SEO still matters, but it's not enough. Before we talk about recommendations, we need to talk about foundations.

*He gestures to the screen with purpose.*

**ERIC (CONT'D)**
Every major AI system already crawls the web -- OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity. Brand Site helps track when they visit, what they read, and whether or not they're being blocked.

(pointing)
Getting started is as easy as dropping a script into your app. From here, Brand Site starts logging AI crawlers on your site. The monitoring is on.

*Click.*

**ERIC (CONT'D)**
We also analyze the robots.txt and llms.txt files -- where crawlers are told what they're allowed to see, and what pages they can access. We give recommendations on how to improve both, so the content of your site can add to the conversation of AI systems.

(turning to Natalie)
But that's not all.

---

*Natalie steps forward. This time, she faces the audience.*

**NATALIE**
(projecting)
This is how we not only get insights on how you're doing right now, but we also give you actionable steps on how to improve it.

*She gestures to the screen confidently.*

**NATALIE (CONT'D)**
We run analysis on how your competitors are doing. We simulate real queries that users have been running. We identify gaps in your content.

(beat)
And these recommendations? They actually work.

*She clicks to the engagement suggestions.*

**NATALIE (CONT'D)**
We give you a list of social media posts you can engage with. We give you copy-and-paste prompts ready to be committed -- take them to Cursor, Claude, or any other IDE to fix your content right now.

---

*Francisco returns for the finale.*

**FRANCISCO**
And why does this matter? By 2026, traditional search activity is going to go down by twenty-five percent -- replaced by AI conversations. By 2028, one hundred fifty billion dollars of buying decisions are going to be made with the help of AI.

*He opens his arms to the audience.*

**FRANCISCO (CONT'D)**
We want to bring your business into that conversation. We invite you to go to our page, log in, have us analyze your site, and start your journey along with us.

(sincere)
Thank you for your time.

### THE BREAKTHROUGH

*The Coach checks the time.*

**COACH**
Three thirty.

*A nod of approval.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
Better. A lot better.

*He walks toward them.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
Here's what I want you to think about. Every company wants more customers. Back in the day, you'd go to search -- Google ad here, blog post there. But that's not the world we live in anymore.

*He mimics a user on their phone.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
Every time we have a question, we're headed to ChatGPT, to Gemini, to get answers. So how do you make sure your business is highlighted by AI?

(pointing at them)
That's your story. Brand Site lets you surface your business to AI, find real insights on how to make it surface better, and gives you actionable ways to improve.

*He paces.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
These are marketers you're talking to. They don't care about crawlers and llms.txt files -- that's going over ninety-five percent of people's heads.

(simplifying)
Just say: "So how do you get surfaced in an LLM? Well, there's this dot text file. That file lets you do X, Y, Z. We handle all the technical aspects so you don't have to worry about anything."

*The founders absorb this.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
You have two key feature sets. Focus on those. Almost like a sizzle reel. And slow down -- you have a ton of time. Take pauses.

*He looks at each of them.*

**COACH (CONT'D)**
Everyone will understand this product if you sell a good story. People will try your product if you sell a good story and make it easy for them.

(final thought)
Cool new thing. Solvable problem. That's it.

---

*The founders exchange knowing looks. They've found their footing.*

**FRANCISCO**
(to the team)
From the top?

*Eric and Natalie nod.*

FADE OUT.

**THE END**
