## Introduction (Host)  
**Cisco (Host):**  
Hello, my name is Francisco. These are my partners, Nataly and Eric.  
And if you can give me 5 minutes of attention, I promise to get you into the conversation of the future.  

**Time:** ~20 seconds  
**Cue:** Slide 0 -- Title / Team introduction

## Opening -- The Shift in Search (Host)  
**Cisco (Host):**  
The way the world searches has changed forever.  

In the past, users searched Google, clicked ten blue links, and visited your site.  
Now, users ask AI--ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity, even Google itself.  
Large language models generate answers at the top of the page.  
The AI answers users directly.  

If AI agents can't read or understand your business, you don't just lose a click.  
You cease to exist. You become invisible to the conversation.  

**Time:** ~45 seconds  
**Cue:** Slide 1 -- "The Shift in Search" (visual: old Google vs. AI answers)

## User Experience Demo -- Dashboard & Onboarding (Host)  
**Cisco (Host):**  
Let's look at the immediate user experience.  

When you log in, the dashboard shows you two critical things:  

First, **Bot Traffic Analytics** -- which AI crawlers are visiting your site right now.  
GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot -- we track them all.  
You can see visit counts, top pages being crawled, and trends over time.  

Second, **Your AEO Score** -- how visible your brand is in AI answers.  

Let me walk you through the analysis process:  

- **Step 1 -- Discovery:** We crawl your site to understand its structure and content.  
- **Step 2 -- Query Identification:** We identify what users and AI agents would ask about your site.  
- **Step 3 -- Research:** Our agents search the web and probe LLMs directly to see where you appear.  
- **Step 4 -- Analysis:** We compare you against competitors and calculate your visibility score.  
- **Step 5 -- Recommendations:** We generate a clear action plan to improve your AEO presence.  
- **Step 6 -- Cursor Prompts:** We give you copy-paste code to implement fixes using AI coding tools.  

Now, while the product is running, I'll hand off to Eric to explain what's happening under the hood.  

**Time:** ~1 minute 15 seconds  
**Cue:** Play prerecorded demo video -- Dashboard onboarding flow

## How It Works (Eric)  
**Eric:**  
Traditional SEO tools were built for humans and keywords, not for AI agents.  

Our platform runs 12 specialized AI agents across 4 phases:  

1. **Discovery** -- We analyze your pages like an LLM would, extracting topics, intent, and entities.  
2. **Research** -- We simulate real searches, query Perplexity, and even probe GPT-4 directly to test if it knows your brand.  
3. **Analysis** -- We calculate your visibility score based on citation rate, ranking quality, and competitive position.  
4. **Output** -- We generate prioritized recommendations and ready-to-use code.  

We also show you what AI bots are allowed to see with our robots.txt and llms.txt analysis.  

**Time:** ~45 seconds  
**Cue:** Show agent pipeline visualization

## Processed Site Example (Host + Nat)  
**Cisco (Host):**  
Now let's switch to a site we've already processed.  
Here you can see the after-analysis report.  

**Nat:**  
This is where the insights come alive:  

- **Scores**: Your AEO Visibility Score, broken down by component.  
- **Key Findings**: What's working and what's not.  
- **Competitor Landscape**: Who's beating you in AI answers.  
- **Recommendations**: Specific, prioritized actions you can take today.  
- **Cursor Prompts**: Copy-paste code for immediate implementation.  

We even show you community engagement opportunities -- where to post on Reddit and X to boost your visibility.  

**Time:** ~45 seconds  
**Cue:** Switch to processed site dashboard -- show "Results" and "Recommendations" tabs

## Bot Traffic Dashboard (Host)  
**Cisco (Host):**  
Let's look at the bot traffic dashboard.  

Here you can see exactly which AI crawlers are visiting your site:  
- How many visits per crawler  
- Which pages they're accessing  
- Trends over time  

We even analyze your robots.txt and llms.txt to show you what you're allowing or blocking.  

This is the measurable payoff.  
The visibility, the engagement, the momentum -- all tracked and proven.  

**Time:** ~45 seconds  
**Cue:** Switch to bot traffic dashboard -- highlight crawler chart and top pages

## Closing -- The Future (Host)  
**Cisco (Host):**  
The future is agentic. The Internet is moving from search to answer.  

Thousands of businesses are waking up today, realizing their traffic is dropping -- and they don't know why.  
Traditional tools are blind to this shift.  

BrandSight gives back their eyes.  
We are building the standard for how business is done in the AI age.  

We invite you to join us in defining the next decade of digital discovery.  
Visit our site, try it out, and thank you for your time.
