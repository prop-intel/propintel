# BrandSite — Live Demo Pitch (Multi-Speaker)

**Total time:** ~5 minutes  
**Tone:** Calm, confident, inevitable  
**Structure:**
- **Francisco** → framing & stakes → closing
- **Eric** → credibility & baseline (SEO → AI crawlers)  
- **Natalie** → differentiation & "magic" (agent analysis)

---

## SPEAKER 1 — FRANCISCO
### ACT 1: The Shift & Stakes (45 seconds)

*Francisco (no screen yet):*

"Two years ago, if you wanted to buy running shoes, you Googled it."

"Today, you ask ChatGPT."

**[Pause. Let silence work.]**

"And when AI answers, it doesn't give you ten links.  
It gives you *one answer*."

**[Beat.]**

"So the most important question for any brand today is:  
*When AI answers questions in your category — are you mentioned?*"

*Turn to the screen (BrandSite homepage).*

"BrandSite exists to answer that question —  
and help brands win that conversation."

---

**Handoff:**

> "To understand why this matters,  
> Eric is going to show you what's already happening behind the scenes."

---

## SPEAKER 2 — ERIC
### ACT 2: The Old World Still Matters — But It's Not Enough (1 minute)

*Screen: AI Crawlers / SEO Baseline Dashboard*

*Eric:*

"Before we talk about AI recommendations,  
we need to talk about foundations."

*Point to crawler list.*

"Every major AI system already crawls the web —  
OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, Google."

*Scroll slowly.*

"BrandSite tracks:
- When they visit
- Which pages they read
- And whether they're being blocked without you realizing it"

---

*Screen: Tracking Setup Dialog*

*Eric:*

"Getting started takes one line of code."

*Click to show tracking script.*

"We generate a tracking pixel for your site.  
You copy it, paste it into your HTML — done."

"From that moment, every AI crawler visit is logged."

---

*Screen: Robots Analysis / Permission Matrix*

*Eric:*

"But tracking is only half the picture."

"BrandSite also generates your `robots.txt` and `llms.txt` files —  
the configuration files that tell AI systems what they're allowed to access."

*Point to permission matrix.*

"This shows you exactly which crawlers can see your content —  
and which ones you've accidentally blocked."

"Most companies don't even know `llms.txt` exists.  
We generate it for you."

**[Pause.]**

"So now you're visible. You're being crawled."

*Lean in slightly.*

"But here's the shift."

"Being crawled doesn't mean being recommended."

**[Let that land.]**

"That's where traditional SEO tools stop —  
and where BrandSite goes deeper."

---

**Handoff:**

> "Natalie's going to show you how we measure  
> what AI *actually says* about your brand."

---

## SPEAKER 3 — NATALIE
### ACT 3: The Recommendation Layer (2 minutes)

*Screen: Click Analyze*

*Natalie:*

"This is the moment that decides winners."

*Click analyze. Let it animate.*

"Instead of guessing,  
BrandSite does exactly what users do."

---

*Screen: Generated Questions*

*Natalie:*

"These are real questions people ask AI  
right before making a decision."

*Read one question aloud.*

"This is where AI either recommends you —  
or recommends someone else."

---

*Screen: AI Answers / Citations*

*Natalie (slow, deliberate):*

"We run these questions against real AI systems."

*Point clearly.*

"Here's who gets cited.  
Here's who doesn't."

**Key line (do not rush):**

"This isn't ranking.  
This is *recommendation placement*."

**[Pause.]**

---

*Screen: AEO Visibility Score*

*Natalie:*

"This score answers the core question."

*Point.*

"How often does AI mention you  
when it actually matters?"

*Add contrast:*

"You can rank first on Google —  
and still never appear here."

**[Silence.]**

---

*Screen: Competitor Comparison*

*Natalie:*

"And we don't just tell you who wins.  
We show *why*."

*Read one insight.*

"They answer the question immediately.  
You don't."

"This comes directly from real AI answers —  
not theory."

**[Pause.]**

"And the good news?  
This is fixable."

---

*Screen: Recommendations*

*Natalie:*

"We don't give you a report.  
We give you a plan."

*Scroll.*

"This is prioritized —  
what to fix first,  
what moves the needle fastest."

---

*Screen: Cursor Prompt*

*Natalie (this is the 'wow' moment):*

"This is where insight turns into execution."

*Click Copy.*

"This is a ready-to-paste Cursor prompt."

"One copy.  
One paste.  
Your content starts speaking AI's language."

---

*Screen: Engagement Opportunities*

*Natalie:*

"And finally — distribution."

"These are live conversations  
where people are already asking for recommendations."

"Instead of guessing where to show up —  
we tell you."

---

**Handoff:**

> "So we can see the problem,  
> measure it,  
> and fix it."
>
> "Now let's talk about why this matters *right now*."

---

## SPEAKER 1 — FRANCISCO (Closing)
### ACT 4: The Inevitable Shift (1 minute, data-driven)

*Screen: Simple slide with 3 numbers*

*Francisco (slow, grounded):*

"Here's what the data already shows."

*Point to first stat:*

"Today, more than half of searches already end without a website click.  
AI answers the question directly."

**[Pause.]**

*Second stat:*

"By 2026, traditional search volume is expected to drop  
by up to 25% as people move from search engines to AI."

**[Pause.]**

*Third stat (anchor):*

"And by 2028, nearly **$750 billion** in buying decisions  
will flow through AI-powered answers."

**[Let silence do work.]**

---

### Final Lines

"This isn't a future trend.  
It's already happening."

"There will be two kinds of brands:  
the ones AI recommends —  
and the ones it never mentions."

*Gesture back to BrandSite.*

"BrandSite shows you where you stand,  
why competitors are winning,  
and exactly how to change it."

**Final line (slow, pause after):**

"In the AI-first internet,  
you're either in the answer…  
or you're not."

"Thank you."

## Presenter Notes

### Speaker Assignments

| Speaker | Role | Duration |
|---------|------|----------|
| **Francisco** | Opens with stakes, closes with data | ~1:45 total |
| **Eric** | Credibility layer (tracking scripts, robots/llms.txt generation, crawlers) | ~1:15 |
| **Natalie** | Differentiation (agent analysis, recommendations) | ~2:00 |

### Why Francisco Should Close

- He opened with vision → symmetry matters
- He's already positioned as "big picture"
- The close is about inevitability, not features
- Eric = credibility, Natalie = differentiation, Francisco = narrative authority

### Key Phrases to Emphasize

- *"One line of code"* — Eric's simplicity hook
- *"Most companies don't even know llms.txt exists"* — Eric's credibility line
- *"Being crawled doesn't mean being recommended"* — Eric's pivot
- *"This isn't ranking. This is recommendation placement."* — Natalie's differentiation
- *"One copy. One paste."* — Cursor prompt wow moment
- *"Here's what the data already shows"* — Francisco's authority opener

### What NOT to Say

- Don't say "let's zoom out" — sounds VC-pitchy
- Don't say "AI agents" too much — say "our system" or "specialized analysis"
- Don't get technical about Tavily, OpenAI, LangChain — audience doesn't care
- Don't oversell — stick to what's actually built

### Delivery Tips

When you remove filler phrases, your **pauses matter more**.

After each stat:
1. Stop talking
2. Count to 2 in your head
3. Let people process

That silence is the authority.
