# BrandSight: The AI Visibility Platform
## 5-Minute Investor Pitch

---

### 1. The Shift (30 Seconds)
**"The way the world searches has changed forever."**

*   **Then:** Users searched Google → Clicked 10 blue links → Visited your site.
*   **Now:** Users ask AI (Perplexity, SearchGPT, Gemini) → AI reads your site → AI answers the user directly.
*   **The Problem:** If AI Agents can't "read" or "understand" your business, you don't just lose a click—you cease to exist. You become **invisible**.
*   **The Gap:** Traditional SEO tools (SEMrush, Ahrefs) optimize for *humans* and *keywords*. They do not optimize for *Agents* and *Context*.

### 2. The Solution: BrandSight (1 Minute)
**"We are the first platform dedicated to AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) & LLMEO."**

BrandSight is the "X-Ray" for the AI Web. We don't just track rankings; we simulate the AI Agents themselves to see exactly how your brand is perceived by the machines that now control discovery.

*   **Visibility, Not Just Ranking:** We show you if you are Cited, Recommended, or Ignored.
*   **Agent-First Analysis:** Our proprietary **4-Phase Pipeline** (Discovery, Research, Analysis, Output) mimics Perplexity, OpenAI, and Google's SGE to test your site's "Machine Readability."
*   **Actionable Fixes:** We don't just list problems. We generate **Cursor Prompts**—ready-to-run code blocks that developers can drop into their IDE to fix the issues instantly.

### 3. Key Features (1 Minute)
**"A Complete Operating System for the AI Age."**

1.  **Multi-Agent Simulation:**
    *   Simulate queries on Perplexity, SearchGPT, and Google.
    *   See your brand through the "eyes" of an LLM.

2.  **The Triple Score System:**
    *   **AEO Score:** How often are you the direct answer?
    *   **LLMEO Score:** How well can an LLM parse your schema and context?
    *   **SEO Score:** Are the technical fundamentals sound?

3.  **Competitor Benchmarking:**
    *   "Why is Stripe recommended over us?"
    *   Side-by-side gap analysis of your competitors' AI visibility.

4.  **One-Click Optimization:**
    *   **Cursor Prompts:** Copy-paste code generation to add missing Schema, fix semantic structure, and optimize for vector search.

### 4. How It Works (30 Seconds)
**"From URL to Optimized in Minutes."**

1.  **Input:** User enters their URL (e.g., `brand-sight.com`).
2.  **Crawl & Research:** Our Orchestrator dispatches "Research Agents" to crawl the site and simultaneously query live AI search engines.
3.  **Analyze:** We compare the site's content against the AI's answers.
4.  **Report:** We generate a comprehensive dashboard showing Gaps, Opportunities, and a prioritized list of fixes.

### 5. The Demo (1 Minute 30 Seconds)
**"Seeing is Believing."**

**[Presenter Note: Use the Interactive Demo on the Landing Page]**

*   **Step 1:** Enter a prospect's URL (e.g., `stripe.com`) into the main input on the homepage.
*   **Step 2:** Click "Analyze" and let them watch the **Agents Active** animation (simulating the 4-Phase Pipeline).
*   **Step 3:** Scroll down to the **"Dashboard Preview"**:
    *   *Highlight:* The "Room to Grow" card (visualizing the gap analysis).
    *   *Highlight:* The **"Cursor Prompt Ready"** button.
    *   *Action:* Explain that this is how we bridge the gap between "Analyst" (Report) and "Engineer" (Fix).

*(Note: The live `/dashboard` currently focuses on Crawler Analytics & Traffic Tracking, while the Analysis Engine runs via API.)*

---

### 5.5. The Validation (30 Seconds)
**"Proof that it works."**

*   **Step 4:** Switch the dashboard view to an active client site (e.g., `brand-sight.com`) with 30 days of data.
*   **Action:** Show the **"Crawler Traffic"** chart trending upward.
*   **Message:** "This is the payoff. After implementing our Cursor Prompts, we see a direct correlation: verified AI Agent visits increase, and 'Answer Share' goes up."

### 6. The Closing (30 Seconds)
**"The Future is Agentic."**

The internet is moving from **Search** to **Answer**.
