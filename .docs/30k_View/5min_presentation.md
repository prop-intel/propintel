# BrandSight: The AI Visibility Platform
## 5-Minute Investor Pitch

---

### 1. The Shift (30 Seconds)
**"The way the world searches has changed forever."**

*   **Then:** Users searched Google → Clicked 10 blue links → Visited your site.
*   **Now:** Users ask AI (Perplexity, SearchGPT, Gemini) → AI reads your site → AI answers the user directly.
*   **The Problem:** If AI Agents can't "read" or "understand" your business, you don't just lose a click—you cease to exist. You become **invisible**.
*   **The Gap:** Traditional SEO tools (SEMrush, Ahrefs) optimize for *humans* and *keywords*. They do not optimize for *Agents* and *Context*.

### 2. The Solution (1:30 - 2:30)

**(Visual: Scroll to "How It Works" section on Landing Page)**

"This is **PropIntel**. We've built the first complete **AEO Intelligence Platform**."

"We don't just optimize meta tags. We simulate the entire AI journey:"

1.  **Discovery**: "Our agents analyze your site exactly like an LLM—extracting entities, intent, and context."
2.  **Research**: "We deploy agents to act like real users, querying Perplexity, SearchGPT, and Google in real-time."
3.  **Analysis**: "We calculate your **Triple Score**:"
    *   **(Visual: Scroll to "Features" section showing the scores)**
    *   **AEO Score**: "How often are you the direct answer?"
    *   **LLMEO Score**: "How well can an LLM parse your schema and context?"
    *   **SEO Score**: "Are the technical fundamentals sound?"
4.  **Action**: "Finally, we generate **Cursor Prompts**. One-click code generation to fix every issue we find."

**(Visual: Show "Cursor Prompt" feature card)**

"It's not a black box anymore. It's a solvable engineering problem."

### 3. The Demo (2:30 - 3:30)

**(Visual: Switch to App Dashboard - "Analyze My Site" flow)**

"Let me show you."

*(Walkthrough of the actual app)*

1.  "I enter a domain—say, `stripe.com`."
2.  "Our agents wake up. You can see them working in real-time."
3.  "Here's the **Result**: A concrete visibility score. AEO, LLMEO, and SEO broken down."
4.  "And here's the magic sauce: **The Recommendations**."
    *   "We don't just say 'improve content'. We say: 'You're missing `Product` schema for this pricing tier'."
    *   "I click 'Generate Prompt', paste it into Cursor, and the fix is live."

### 5.5. The Validation (30 Seconds)
**"Proof that it works."**

*   **Step 4:** Switch the dashboard view to an active client site (e.g., `brand-sight.com`) with 30 days of data.
*   **Action:** Show the **"Crawler Traffic"** chart trending upward.
*   **Message:** "This is the payoff. After implementing our Cursor Prompts, we see a direct correlation: verified AI Agent visits increase, and 'Answer Share' goes up."

### 6. The Closing (30 Seconds)
